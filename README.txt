The code you provided was just ok. It could take me almost 7-8 hours to completely make it perfect.There is alot of repitative code. Functions should be used. 
Using of direct env without config, not a good practice.
Logger should also had dependency injection. 
At many places pagination could be used laravel default pagination. You are doing it manually.
Validations arent there in any function. 
Comments are missing.
You could've used constants rather than giving hard coded values.
